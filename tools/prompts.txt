Rain falling on a puddle with rippling reflections
A fountain with water splashing in sunlight, slow motion

A sunrise over mountains followed by a bustling indoor market
A calm lake scene that transitions to a crowded subway platform

A rack focus shot from a foreground object to a distant landscape
Soft bokeh lights at night slowly coming into focus

# === CLEAN simple ===
# Low complexity, slow scenes: still landscape, single object

A single red apple on a white table with soft lighting
A sleeping cat curled up on a sunny windowsill
